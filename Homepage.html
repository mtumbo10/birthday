      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Hoi! Welcome to the insanely archaic, coded attempt at a scavenger hunt. 
        The scavenger hunt is broken into 3 puzzles listed at the top of the page.
         Each puzzle will either unlock geographical locations or games. Scrolling 
         your mouse over each puzzle creates a drop-down list with 3 options:
         <ol>
          <li><em>Puzzle</em>: The actual puzzle and instructions</li>
          <li><em>Solution Checker</em>: A checker to confirm your answers</li>
          <li><em>Solution</em>: For AFTER you finish the puzzle - includes the solution and any important information you'll need for next steps</li>
         </ol>
      <p-2><em>NOTE: The solution page is basically just the answers, so if the coding is wrong, you can just go straight here, but fingers crossed cause it's not as fun</em></p-2>
      <p>Puzzles #1 and #2 will send you on an adventure to pick up materials. Puzzle #3 will unlock the rules of a new card game...magician (hahaha). </p>

      <h3>Time Estimate</h3>
      <p>I'm estimating puzzle #1/2 will likely take you ~1hr walking or 30min
         biking to go, pick-up everything, and get back. The furthest place is
          25 minutes away (walking, only 7 biking), but I'm assuming you might
           run into some yappers so I built in extra time to the estimate.
            Honestly, I am realizing I didn't think of possible hand restrictions,
             so I would either plan to bike with a backpack/basket or take a
              friend or two. It should also be easy to split trips, but alack
               alas lmk if there are issues.
