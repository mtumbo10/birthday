					 <br><br>Woooo!!! Another year around the sun, imagine that!
					  I know you hate birthdays - trust me, I get it… between the
					   expectations/singing/etc. it can all be a bit cheesy and
					    stressful - but you deserve to have the best day, so I 
						wanted to do something to celebrate you!
					 <br><br>I kept going back and forth on what the best thing
					 would be, and omgggg what an adventure trying to figure it
					  out….
					 <br><br>I will def explain it all to you another time but
					  could not stop thinking about your idea of a perfect day
					   and the intersection of connecting with people, nature,
					    and yourself.
					 <br><br>I couldn't guarantee nature wouldn't be freezing,
					  so I tried to find a fun balance between the other two. 
					 <br><br>The next page is the start of a "scavenger hunt" for
					  a few things to make your day fun :) I am hoping to get this
					   to you a day early so that you can possibly get your friends
					    involved (*cough cough* also give them the early heads up
						that it's your bday)! I know you really value experiences, so I 
						tried my best to gift quality time so you could spend it
						 with them! Click to stamp to get started
					<br><br>Good Luck!<br><br> Maddie
