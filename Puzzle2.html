      <h3>Instructions!</h3>
      <p> Woo! Welcome to the second puzzle! This puzzle is based off of Codenames. I am unsure if 
        you have played the traditional game before, so I can give a quick run-down here.
    </br></br> A normal game of Codenames is usually played between two teams: Red and Blue. 
      Members of a team are split into a team leader and the rest of the group. To start the game,
       25 codename tiles (see below) are placed on the playing table. The team leaders pull 
        a gameplay card showing which game board tiles their team is trying to guess. This gameplay card looks
        like this: </br>
        <img src="Codenames_Card.png"></br>
         Leaders give their teams one word hints and a # to help their teams pick the Blue/Red tiles based on the gameplay card.
         For example, if leaders need their team to guess "Mole", "Spot", and "Face",
         they might make their codeword "Dermatology - 3". The goal of the game is to get
         your team to guess as many tiles as possible in the shortest amount of time. </br></br>

         Obviously that is a not possible to play in this format. Instead, this puzzle is a shortened 
         version of a game. </br> </br>
         Your goal is to use the colorized list below to match the Red/Blue card and solve for the blank tiles on the gameboard below.
         Any remaining cards without matches will be the blank tiles. You should expect to see one remaining card in each column. </br> </br>

         Reading left to right, you will be able to create a list of words. For example, if Texas,
          Chop, Elephant, Marbles, and Lion are the unmatched cards, this will be your list of words.
          The first letter of each word will create your "solution" to this part of the problem 
          (e.g., in example above: T,C,E,M,L). </br> </br>

          You can check your answer <a href="puzzle2_solution_checker.html">here</a></br> </br>

          Once you have the correct 5-letter word, you can use the cypher below to de-crypt the location
          for the next stop.

      <h3>Cypher</h3>
      <p> Use the 5 letter word from above and this cypher to de-crypt where you are off to next:</br> </br>
        Hello = URYYB
    </br> </br>
    This should be pretty easy (think reflection), but I'll include some hints here
        <ol>
            <li>A = N</li>
            <li>B = O</li>
            <li>M = Z</li>  
        </ol>
